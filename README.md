Helium represents an exciting new endeavour in theme development for Shopify. This repository is dedicated to bringing forth a wave of innovative features and enhancements that will revolutionize the online shopping experience.

The focus is on maximizing e-commerce conversion by refining the UI aesthetics of Shopify themes and the goal is to create visually stunning designs that captivate users and elevate the overall appeal of online stores.

- **Maximizing e-commerce conversion:** We will be implementing elements such as a shipping progress bar and a free gift option in the cart drawer. These features aim to streamline the purchasing process and incentivize customers to complete their transactions.
- **New creative sections:** We are thrilled to introduce innovative sections that allow merchants to showcase their products in imaginative ways. These sections offer flexibility in presenting product collections, highlighting unique features, and capturing the attention of potential customers. Merchants will have the ability to link collections, blog articles, and other related content seamlessly within these creative sections. It will provide an engaging and visually appealing way to showcase products and create an immersive shopping experience.
- **User-requested functionalities:** We highly value feedback from the community and actively strive to incorporate features that users have been requesting. By listening to their needs and preferences, we aim to create a repository that addresses their specific requirements. We are committed to implementing functionalities that improve the overall shopping experience and provide merchants with the tools they need to succeed.
