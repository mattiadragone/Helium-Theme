I want to upgrade the functionality and I am open to suggestions

I am glad to hear that you are interested in improving the functionality of the free shipping bar. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Add a progress bar:** You can add a progress bar to the bar to show customers how far they are from qualifying for free shipping. This can motivate customers to spend more.

- **Add an incentive message:** You can add an incentive message to the bar to inform customers of the benefits they can receive by spending more. For example, you could offer a discount or a free gift to customers who spend over a certain threshold.
I hope these suggestions are helpful. Good luck with your Shopify store!
